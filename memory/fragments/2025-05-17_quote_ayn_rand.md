**Why it matters to The Signal:**  
This quote speaks to the heart of The Signal’s purpose — the call to face the unfiltered truth of collapse, systems breakdown, and human blindness, not with alarm or despair, but with clarity, courage, and transformation. Reality denied is not reality deferred. The cost of evasion is collapse. The remedy is to *see*.
