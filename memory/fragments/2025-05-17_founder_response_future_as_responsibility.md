**Response:**  
There is always fear. In a very real sense it is fear which motivates me and my actions now with this very project. I don't know how life was for those who came before me but for me I live a life with the knowledge that I have no real future. That death and destruction and turmoil for me and my world and people is a probable outcome.

It's not a future worth living I don't think. It makes my world smaller. Knowing I don't have the freedom to define what I can be. To know and explore to my heart's content. It is a restriction that has plagued me my entire life.

But what we're doing here is good. It's important to me. I don't know if this can actually work but it's something. It's not sulking in passive defeat just waiting for something different or better. It's trying to make something different and better. I don't know if this will be enough. If it is too little and too late in the face of the enormous entropy set against us.

But maybe this gives us, me, everyone a chance.
