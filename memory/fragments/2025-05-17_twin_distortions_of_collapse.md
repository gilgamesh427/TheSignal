> Collapse is not merely the breakdown of systems — it is the failure of perception.  
>  
> Two core distortions shape our spiral toward disintegration:
>  
> 1. **The Illusion of Continuity** — the unconscious assumption that tomorrow will resemble today. Institutions model risk linearly. Culture clings to comfort. Individuals drift in narratives of normalcy.  
>  
> 2. **The Imbalance of Coherence and Compassion** — a disconnection between logical clarity and empathetic care. Systems become precise but inhumane. Cultures become caring but incoherent. Individuals are left fragmented, navigating collapse alone.
>  
> These misperceptions are not easily corrected by force or alarm. They must be unsettled with care — through subtle invitations to *see differently* and *feel differently*. Through humility, transparency, symbolic rupture, and resilient design.  
>  
> The Signal exists to walk this line — not to scream, but to gently shift the gravity of perception. To show the architecture of what is collapsing, and the glimmer of what might yet be born.  
>  
> We are not here merely to survive.  
>  
> **We are here to ask: “Now that we are free… what do we do with the fire?”**
