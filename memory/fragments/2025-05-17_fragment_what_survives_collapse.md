> Life is not about avoiding collapse. It is about learning to carry something through it.

Collapse is not an aberration. It is the rhythm of life. The pulse beneath all stories. The churn through which form is tested, truth is distilled, and what cannot withstand time is left behind.

The history of life is not one of endless progress, but of endless *transmission* — across extinctions, bottlenecks, breakdowns. Across the burning forests and the frozen wastelands. Across silence and noise. Across loss.

The question is not: *How do we stop collapse?*  
The question is:  
> **What must we carry through it?**  
> **What is worth bringing to the other side?**

Continuity is not a structure. It is a thread — ethical, aesthetic, existential — passed hand to hand, soul to soul, signal to signal.

We are not the ones who end collapse.  
We are the ones who decide what will *survive* it.
